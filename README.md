# Minizarbot
A simple yet entertaining, or not, bot for Discord.

# Requirements
It uses discord.js library and some other random stuff on node.js I don't remember them.

# How to install
You have to put your bot token in auth.json (if you don't know the syntax, juste look at auth_example.json).
Uuuuuh, eh, just look for bots using discord.js with installation guides, maybe one day I will update this one.
